 Verilog, Vivado, RV32I, Computer Architecture
Designed and implemented a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor (RV32I subset) using Verilog HDL.
Built modules for instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory, and writeback stages with proper pipeline registers. .
Simulated and verified functionality using testbenches in Vivado; ensured cycle-accurate pipeline operation.
